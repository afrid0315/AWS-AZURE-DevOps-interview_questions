## Terraform Interview Questions and Answers

#### 1. What is Terraform?

Answer. Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, you can manage and automate the creation, modification, and versioning of cloud and on-premises infrastructure, ensuring consistency and repeatability in infrastructure deployments.

#### 2. When you created the environment using Terraform? What are all the components that you have created using Terraform?
**Answer.** I have experience creating environments using Terraform in previous roles. I utilized Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure components such as EC2 instances, VPCs, security groups, IAM roles and policies, S3 buckets.

#### 3. How to do changes in the configurations of already created resources using Terraform?
**Answer.** To make changes to existing resources in Terraform, you can modify the Terraform configuration files and then apply those changes using the terraform apply command. Terraform will automatically detect the differences and update the resources accordingly, ensuring the desired state matches the configured state. 

But, existing resources that were not initially created by Terraform. You want to bring them under Terraform management, then use Terraform import command. It will bring all details to terraform state.
```
terraform import aws_instance.example i-0123456789abcdef0
```

#### 4. What is statefile? Where can we store it?
**Answer.** The statefile in Terraform is a crucial file that tracks the current state of your infrastructure. It contains information about the resources Terraform manages, their configurations, and relationships. This file is used to plan and apply changes. You can store the statefile locally or remotely. For collaboration and consistency, it's recommended to use remote backends like AWS S3 or HashiCorp Terraform Cloud to store and share the statefile among team members.

#### 5. What if we loose or delete terraform statefile? How to resolve it?
**Answer.** If the Terraform statefile is lost, it can lead to issues in managing infrastructure. To recover, you can attempt to recreate the statefile by importing existing resources using 'terraform import'. However, for a more robust solution, it's advisable to maintain backups of the statefile and store it securely. Services like Terraform Cloud or using remote backends with version control systems can mitigate the risk of losing the statefile.

#### 6. What are the main features of Terraform?
**Answer.** Terraform's main features include declarative configuration using HCL or JSON, infrastructure as code (IaC) principles, can perform in multiple cloud platform like aws,azure, etc.. And statefile tracks you to resource changes, a broad provider ecosystem, modularity for code reuse, parallel execution for efficiency, integration with version control to commit configurations, and strong community support.

#### 7. What is mean by HCL in terraform?
**Answer.** HCL stands for HashiCorp Configuration Language. It is a domain-specific language (DSL) created by HashiCorp and used by tools like Terraform for writing configuration files. In the context of Terraform, HCL is used to define the infrastructure in a human-readable and structured format.

#### 8. Which version of terraform are you currently using?
**Answer.** Terraform version windows - 1.3.9,
Terraform version linux - 1.3.3, 1.6.6 amd64 linux
In provider section I had mention terraform version as 5.10.0, 5.30.0 (any latest versions)

#### 9. Why we use 'terraform validate' and 'terraform fmt' command?
**Answer.** The 'terraform validate' command is used to check the syntax and validity of Terraform configuration files (written in HCL) without actually deploying any infrastructure. It helps catch errors early in the development process, ensuring that the configuration is correctly formatted and free of syntax errors before applying changes.

The 'terraform fmt' command is used to reads your Terraform configuration files and rewrites them with a consistent style, ensuring proper indentation, spacing, and other formatting rules.

#### 10. Can you explain about any terraform lifecycle?
**Answer.** A typical Terraform lifecycle includes:

**Initialization (terraform init):** Downloads provider plugins and initializes the working directory. This step is crucial before applying any changes.

**Planning (terraform plan):** Examines the current infrastructure, determines the changes required to achieve the desired state, and produces an execution plan. The plan is a preview of what Terraform will do.

**Validation (terraform validate):** Checks the syntax and configuration of Terraform files for errors without making any changes to the infrastructure.

**Application (terraform apply):** Executes the changes proposed in the execution plan, creating, updating, or deleting resources to bring the infrastructure to the desired state.

**Destroy (terraform destroy):** Destroys all resources created by Terraform, effectively tearing down the entire infrastructure.

These steps collectively form the Terraform lifecycle, providing a structured approach to managing infrastructure as code.

#### 11. Differences between Terraform and Ansible? Which is better to use?
**Answer.** The choice between Terraform and Ansible depends on the specific use cases. Both are best in their use cases.

| Comparison Factor | Terraform  | Ansible  |
| ------- | --- | --- |
| Type | Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.  | Configuration Management and Automation tool.  |
| Purpose | Provisioning and managing infrastructure resources. | Configuration, orchestration, and automation of software and server tasks. |
| Language | HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON. | YAML (Yet Another Markup Language). |
| Execution | Declarative; defines desired state and computes the necessary actions. | Procedural; defines the steps to achieve a desired state. |
| State Management | Maintains a state file to track the current infrastructure state. | Stateless; executes tasks without maintaining persistent state. |
| Scope | Focuses on creating and managing infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and on-premises environments. | Primarily used for configuring and managing software on existing servers; also supports cloud provisioning but has a broader range of use cases beyond infrastructure provisioning. |

#### 12. Tell me about arm templates?
**Answer.** ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates are JSON files used in Microsoft Azure. Where as in AWS they have Cloud Formation templates. Both are having infrastructure as code services individually.

#### 13. If we are having 15 resources in terraform but we have to delete 1 resource among them? Is it possible and how?
**Answer.** Yes, we can delete the particular resource by using 'terraform destroy' command or 'terraform rm'(remove) command.
```
terraform destroy -target=aws_instance.example
```

#### 14. How do you preserve your keys in terraform?
**Answer.** The common approach to preserving keys, passwords is to use environment variables or a secure key management system like HashiCorp Vault.

#### 15. What are modules?
**Answer.** In Terraform, modules are a way to encapsulate and reuse groups of resources or configurations. They enable code organization and reusability by allowing you to abstract and package related resources together. Modules can be used to create reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain infrastructure as code.

#### 16. What is remote backend?
**Answer.** 
A remote backend in Terraform refers to storing the Terraform state file in a remote location, separate from the local working directory. This facilitates collaboration and enables a consistent state across a team. Popular remote backends include AWS S3, Azure Storage, and HashiCorp Terraform Cloud. Using a remote backend improves state management, allows for concurrent collaboration, and provides features like locking to prevent conflicting changes.

#### 17. Is there any way to manage terraform code into multiple environments?
**Answer.** Yes, Terraform allows for managing code across multiple environments using various strategies:
1. Use Terraform workspaces to maintain separate state files for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
```
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod
```
2. Leverage variable files to define environment-specific values.
```
# dev.tfvars
instance_count = 3

# prod.tfvars
instance_count = 10
```
3. Configure different remote backends for each environment to store state files separately.

#### 18. Why we use resource in terraform and where?
**Answer.** In Terraform, resources are used to represent and define the infrastructure components you want to create or manage. They are specified in Terraform configuration files and are associated with a specific provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

#### 19. About Provisioners?
**Answer.** Provisioners in Terraform are used to execute scripts or commands on a resource after it's created or updated. They help in configuring and customizing resources, such as installing software or performing post-deployment tasks. Provisioners should be used judiciously, as they may introduce dependencies and hinder Terraform's declarative nature.

#### 20. Types of Provisioners?
**Answer.** Three types of provisioners:
1. **file Provisioner:**

   The `file` provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the local machine to a remote machine. This is useful for deploying configuration files, scripts, or other assets to a provisioned instance.

   Example:

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }

   provisioner "file" {
     source      = "local/path/to/localfile.txt"
     destination = "/path/on/remote/instance/file.txt"
     connection {
       type     = "ssh"
       user     = "ec2-user"
       private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
     }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `file` provisioner copies the `localfile.txt` from the local machine to the `/path/on/remote/instance/file.txt` location on the AWS EC2 instance using an SSH connection.

2. **remote-exec Provisioner:**

   The `remote-exec` provisioner is used to run scripts or commands on a remote machine over SSH or WinRM connections. It's often used to configure or install software on provisioned instances.

   Example:

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }

   provisioner "remote-exec" {
     inline = [
       "sudo yum update -y",
       "sudo yum install -y httpd",
       "sudo systemctl start httpd",
     ]

     connection {
       type        = "ssh"
       user        = "ec2-user"
       private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
       host        = aws_instance.example.public_ip
     }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `remote-exec` provisioner connects to the AWS EC2 instance using SSH and runs a series of commands to update the package repositories, install Apache HTTP Server, and start the HTTP server.

3. **local-exec Provisioner:**

   The `local-exec` provisioner is used to run scripts or commands locally on the machine where Terraform is executed. It is useful for tasks that don't require remote execution, such as initializing a local database or configuring local resources.

   Example:

   ```hcl
   resource "null_resource" "example" {
     triggers = {
       always_run = "${timestamp()}"
     }

     provisioner "local-exec" {
       command = "echo 'This is a local command'"
     }
   }
   ```

   In this example, a `null_resource` is used with a `local-exec` provisioner to run a simple local command that echoes a message to the console whenever Terraform is applied or refreshed. The `timestamp()` function ensures it runs each time.

#### 21. Do you know Terraform Blockers?
