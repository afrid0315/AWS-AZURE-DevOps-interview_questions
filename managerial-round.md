#### 17. Why AWS and Amazon? 

#### Why deployment?

#### Why, like, what's the benefit of using Ansible?

#### What's one thing that makes Ansible different from any other tool for example, Chef, Puppet or anything like that?

#### Is Ansible agent or agentless?

#### What does it use to communicate with the host?

#### How does Ansible interact with the servers?

#### What have you automated so far in terms of that, like what have you configured on the host using Ansible playbook?

#### You mentioned Docker what is Docker like if you want to generalize it, and how would you go about defining Docker?

#### Is Docker container itself or container runtime?

#### Why would you use Docker? Over a virtual machine and give an example?

#### Let's say I have like okay, I have a Docker image in Docker Hub. And I want to, like use that image to start a Docker container on your local laptop or an EC2 instance what command would we use?

#### If I want to create an Docker image. What command would I use?

#### What's the difference between Docker build and Docker Compose?

#### For example, let's say you have X number of Docker containers running on a machine right and maybe an instant easy to instance or server or whatever. How would you check those containers like what command would you use?

#### Let's say there was seven containers running on a machine out of those two stops for some reason. And someone asks you like hey, can we check what happened to those two containers? Like what can you do from here to see why those two containers stopped?

#### Let's say the server is running straight because you go to AWS console and you can see your instance running straight right. A better system is still not working any have also checked up the inbound rule is correct and security group is allowing port 22 and instances in public subnet. Any commands you can run to check where might be the issue lying with this?

#### you ping it you get a response right? What does that mean?

#### when you use ping does it only check network connectivity or does it check connectivity on a specific port?

#### What if you want to check connectivity on a certain website on a specific port, for example. You do Ping google.com You get a response right? It means that you can communicate with Google as in your laptop from where you ran that command is communicating with google.com Just fine. However, if you want to communicate with Google, let's say on port 8080. How would you check connectivity for that?

#### Let's say you create a website. Just for example, right? It's your own website, where you know you put in details about your life and stuff. And it's hosted on, let's say www yourname.com. Write your name means that can.com That's fine. So when you pick that you get a response. We have been in this from your own laptop or computer whatever you use, right? It means okay connectivity is there however you want to communicate to your website on a specific port. For example, let the port number be 8080 How would you check connectivity with your website on port 8080 Like what one would use?

#### the command you will use to check both connectivity. To check port is open or not.
