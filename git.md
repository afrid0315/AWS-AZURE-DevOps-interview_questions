#### 1.Git rebase vs git merge?
**Answer.** Git Rebase: Rewrites the commit history by moving or combining commits. Results in a linear history, but use with caution in shared branches.

Git Merge: Integrates changes from one branch into another, creating a merge commit. Preserves the commit history but can result in a more complex history graph.

Choose between them based on your project's needs and collaboration workflow. Use rebase for a cleaner history or merge for a more explicit record of changes.
