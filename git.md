#### 1.Git rebase vs git merge?
**Answer.** Git Rebase: Rewrites the commit history by moving or combining commits. Results in a linear history, but use with caution in shared branches.

Git Merge: Integrates changes from one branch into another, creating a merge commit. Preserves the commit history but can result in a more complex history graph.

Choose between them based on your project's needs and collaboration workflow. Use rebase for a cleaner history or merge for a more explicit record of changes.

#### 2. What is difference between git and github?
**Answer.** Git: Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows users to track changes in source code during software development. It provides features for branching, merging, and collaborating on code with others.

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git that provides hosting for Git repositories, collaboration tools, and additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and code review. It serves as a central hub for developers to share and collaborate on code.
