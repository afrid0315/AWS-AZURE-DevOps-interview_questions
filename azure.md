## Azure Interview Q/A

#### 1. What exactly you have done in your current project?

Answer- 

#### 2. How many pipeline you have created?

Answer- I have experience creating and managing multiple CI/CD pipelines to automate the software delivery process. The exact number depends on the projects I've worked on. I've implemented pipelines using popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins. These pipelines typically include stages for building, testing, and deploying applications. I emphasize the importance of version control integration, automated testing, and deployment strategies to achieve efficient and reliable software delivery.

#### 3. How many environments do you have in your project?

Answer- In my current project, we have implemented a comprehensive environment strategy to support various stages of the development lifecycle. We typically maintain three main environments:

**Development Environment:**

Used by individual developers for coding and initial testing. It mirrors the production environment in terms of infrastructure and configuration.

**Testing Environment:**

A shared environment for integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. It closely resembles the production environment to identify issues before deployment.

**Production Environment:**

The live environment where the application is accessible to end-users. We follow a robust deployment process, including automation and monitoring, to ensure smooth and reliable production releases.
Additionally, we may have specialized environments for specific purposes, such as staging for final pre-production environment.

#### 4. While deployment, how exactly you have maintained the approval process?

**Answer-** In our deployment process, maintaining a robust approval workflow is crucial for ensuring controlled and reliable releases. We have implemented the following strategies:

**Manual Approvals:**

For critical environments such as production, we incorporate manual approval gates. Before proceeding with the deployment, designated stakeholders or team leads review the proposed changes and explicitly approve or reject them.

**Automated Testing Gates:**

We integrate automated testing gates within the deployment pipeline. The deployment progresses only if all automated tests pass successfully. This ensures that the code meets quality standards before reaching production.

**Integration with Collaboration Tools:**

To streamline communication and approvals, we leverage collaboration tools such as Slack or Microsoft Teams. Deployment notifications are sent to relevant channels, allowing team members to stay informed and providing a platform for quick approval or discussions.

**Version Control Integration:**

Our deployment process is tightly integrated with version control systems. Changes are tracked, and the deployment pipeline automatically triggers approvals based on the configured criteria.

**Rollback Plans:**

Before each deployment, we define and communicate rollback plans. In case of unforeseen issues post-deployment, an immediate rollback can be executed with minimal impact.
